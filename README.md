# 🧱 Eurocode 2 (NF EN 1992-1-1 / EC2) – Concrete Structural Class Calculator

Use this online tool to quickly and accurately calculate the structural class of concrete according to Eurocode 2 (NF EN 1992-1-1 / EC2) standards.

## 🔍 Overview

Welcome to the Concrete Structural Class Calculator. This tool helps you determine the appropriate structural class of concrete for your project based on key parameters, ensuring compliance with Eurocode durability requirements.

By entering values such as service life, exposure class, concrete strength, cement type, and reinforcement cover conditions, you’ll receive a reliable recommendation tailored to your design.

## ⚙️ How to Use

Fill in the specific values for each parameter listed below:

### 1. Service Life  
Define the intended lifespan of the structure in years.

### 2. Exposure Class  
Select the appropriate exposure class based on the environmental conditions surrounding the concrete structure:

- `XC`: Low aggressiveness (carbonation)
- `XD`: Moderate aggressiveness (chlorides from de-icing)
- `XS`: High aggressiveness (chlorides from seawater)
- `XF`: Freeze/thaw cycles
- `XA`: Chemical attack

### 3. Concrete Strength Class  
Choose the characteristic strength class required for your structure, such as `C20/25`, `C30/37`, etc.  
This depends on load-bearing and performance requirements.

### 4. Cement Type  
Select the cement type used in the concrete mix:

- `CEM I`: Portland cement  
- `CEM I (CV)`: Portland cement without fly ash  
- `CEM II`: Composite cement  
- `CEM III`: Blast furnace cement  
- `CEM IV`: Pozzolanic cement  
- `CEM V`: Composite cement

### 5. Reinforcement Cover Type  
Specify the compaction condition of the concrete around the reinforcement:

- **Compact cover**: Good compaction  
- **Non-compact cover**: Poor compaction

> Compact cover typically applies to reinforcement near the bottom surface of slabs or ribbed floors cast horizontally on industrial or metal formwork.
